									    <p class="text">
											I love music and music loves me, period!! I remember back when I was in high school, I was a good academic performer, and everybody had their expectations of what I should be after school. Majority felt that I was destined to follow the same old routine of “going to school, getting good grades and securing myself a nice paying job (as Robert Kiyosaki would put it).” But I already knew where my heart was. Music would be my way out of misery and poverty. It was my future, my love, my destiny.  It was clear to me that I was born for this. When I told my friends and family about it, I received mixed reactions from them. Some were supportive, most were skeptical about it. So I went on to join Daystar University, one of the leading institutions of higher learning in my country, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Community Development in 2012. Two years down the line, I still had not secured a permanent job. I felt kind of lost.<br><br> 
											But every day, I kept writing down songs describing what I felt and experienced. Although I did not have a steady source of income, I felt happy about my music 24/7. I kept imagining what it would be like to live in the limelight, brushing shoulders with the celebrities I was watching on TV back then. Reading motivational books daily made me believe in the fact that I could actually stir my life in any direction I chose. Just like others who have made it big in the game, I could actually make a living from my gift. Something kept egging me on to make music my full time occupation. What a major step to take! Although many people liked my songs, most of them did not think it was a secure enough career for me to pursue. But I knew what I wanted, and I would do everything I could to have it. I was ‘willing to do at that moment what others weren’t willing to do, in order to have tomorrow what others wouldn’t have.’ By practicing daily, I was now turning my gift into a skill.
											With time, my plans for the future kept evolving as my understanding of what was truly important became clearer in my mind.  	
											My thoughts about how to use my musical talent gradually took a new turn as I discovered another special gift, public speaking. Equipped with these two, I found myself working with the Unlimited Mind Kampaign (UMK), an initiative that is aimed at encouraging young people in high schools and colleges to pursue their sincerest dreams no matter what people think or say about them. Up to date, we have talked to many youngsters, reminding them that WHATEVER THE MIND CAN IMAGINE, IT CAN ACHIEVE. I am a living testimony to that because I am doing what I have always wanted to do-performing on stage, inspiring people through my music and public speaking. These are the two gifts I was given and I am using them to the best of my ability. I am making an income doing what I was born to enjoy doing. I wake up happy, with a purpose and direction, and a sense of fulfillment.<br><br>
											Through all this, I have tried to learn as much as I can about how to brand and market myself as an artist. It has been a challenging but worthwhile journey. It has taken me quite some time to get to where I am and I wouldn’t want other young and promising artists to have to learn all this by themselves because it might take them too long to get to their goal. My desire is to help young and aspiring musicians learn what they need to about the music industry. I believe that this could help shorten the time it would have taken them to make a name for themselves in the entertainment industry.  This is another major project we are working on in conjunction with BlakCanary Studios, an entertainment and artist management company in Kenya.
											And now, I take this pleasure to introduce you to my music. I have just published a 12 track LP dubbed “Frank Cinematic”, containing multiple inspirational tracks, advisory music, patriotic songs and party anthems. It is available for streaming and free download right <span><a id="link" href="music.html">here.</a></span>

								<p class="text"><span class="spn">Me in summary:</span>  My name is Montero Kirilenko. I am a gifted, versatile Singer/Rapper who started ‘playing with words’ while still in high school. I used to entertain my peers and teachers during school talent shows and other special occasions in my neighborhood. After taking some time off to rediscover and reinvent myself, I started working on my material and it's been months now and am eager to get started with showcasing my skill to the world. My sound is similar to my crazy mixture of influences like Drake, Jay z, Meek Mill, Rick Ross, Wale, Wiz Kid and Dj Cleo.
